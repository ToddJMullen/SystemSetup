# SystemSetup
A list of steps, commands, references, &amp; environment items to setup on a new system.

The combination of things that will be added here are uncertain, but my general thoughts is that I will create a repo with all the steps, commands, & references that I've used while setting up systems.

This isn't meant to be a step-by-step tutorial of how to set a system up, but more like a checklist with found information & references.
