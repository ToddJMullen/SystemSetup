## Create Restore Disk

Windows Menu > Type "Restore Disk" > Create Sytem Recovery Drive
It stated that the drive must be at least 16Gb, initial drive is 16Gb.


## Shrink Volume

To keep Windows alongside with Linux, but not waste hard disk space, the Win partition should be reduced.
Typically, windows will only suggest that it can be shrunk ~50% even on new systems.  This is due to
'unmovable' files that are in the 'middle' of the hard disk.  I believe they are put there strategically, but that's just
my feeling about it.  As I remember, the files are related to Hibernation, but once moved to an appropriate location,
then the Windows partition can be shrunk to the space actually being used.

### Remove unmovable files

1. [x] Disable hibernate
   1. Open Admin command prompt
   2. `> powercfg /h off`
2. [x] Disable page file
   1. Super (Windows) > "Advanced System Settings" > (Performance) Settings > Advanced (tab) > Virtual Memory (Change)
    (uncheck) Automatically manage paging filesize > "No Paging File" > Set > (Yes to warning) > Ok > Ok 
3. [x] Disable system restore
    "Advanced System Settings" > "System Protection" (tab) > "Configure" > "Disable System Protection" > (Yes to warning)
4. [x] Restart (They should be gone)
5. []

### Shrink Volume

1. [x] Super (Windows) + X > Disk Management > Right Click System Volume > Type number of Mb to shrink the volume
    The right boundary of the volume will be shifted left that amount & leave that space unallocated on the right.

### Windows System Repair

This may not be needed usually. I have done the same steps on my previous Acer without problems, but After shrinking the volume, there were frequent crashed of Firefox & Opera, "Out of memory" errors, & random screen freezing or blanking.
Thinking that they might have config flags that pointed to disk locations that were no longer valid, I tried reinstalling both, but it did not fix the problem.  I found & tried the following commands run 
with admin privileges:
`sfc /scannow`
followed by
`Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`

Ref: [Microsoft Forum](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93)

This *seemed* to work for a while, but the system is still very crashy when trying to browser 'normally' (Opera + Firefox ~45 tabs together).

Symptoms: Tabs keep crashing, browsers keep crashing, video display goes black and fails to correct. Generally when the video goes black, closing the lid until it goes to sleep & opening it back up is the only way I've been able to 'recover' the display (holding the power button ~45s did not even do *anything* -- including not shutting it off).  Even then, the display is corrupted as I am typing this the lock screen & desktop are scrambled together.


### Addendum

I had added more notes on trying to recover Windows, but did not push the changes.  While playing with the installing options for POP OS, 
I kept getting warnings about the partition asking me if I wanted to repair it. I ignored it multiple times as I played with options, but at some point I thought perhaps that would repair the problem with the random crashes in Windows and I agreed to let it 'repair' the partition. 
I have not been able to log back into Windows since.  I attempted to repair or recover Windows numberous ways,
but Windows kept complaining that it couldn't start.  I did/do not have the restore disk with me as I went traveling spontaneously some time back.
I decided to complete the installation and continue as is. I will try to recover it again when I get back home.


# Pop OS - Post Install

### Wireshark Permission Denied Error

Trying to run after installation gives a "Couldnâ€™t run /usr/bin/dumpcap in child process: Permission denied" error because I (the user) 
does not have permission to record the network.  
Temp fix:
`bash
> sudo wireskark
`

Permanent fix:
`bash
> sudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER

### ThinkOrSwim


`bash
> # Enable Universe to install Open JDK. Note: Universe includes all Community-Maintained, Open-Source Software
> sudo add-apt-repository universe
> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
> cd ~/Downloads
> sudo chmod +x thinkorswim_installer.sh
> ./thinkorswim_installer.sh
`
Note: No JRE/JDK was present in Pop OS, so unlike my previous systems, there was no need to switch / manage other versions or create desktop
    links to alter PATH before starting ToS.
